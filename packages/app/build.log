âœ” Using remote iOS credentials (Expo server)

We found that the scheme you want to build consists of many targets.
You have to set up credentials for each of the targets.
They can share the same Distribution Certificate but require separate Provisioning Profiles.

Setting up credentials for following targets:
- Target: OneKeyWallet
  Bundle Identifier: novai.npay.wallet
- Target: ServiceExtension
  Bundle Identifier: novai.npay.wallet.ServiceExtension

Setting up credentials for target OneKeyWallet (novai.npay.wallet)

If you provide your Apple account credentials we will be able to generate all necessary build credentials and fully validate them.
This is optional, but without Apple account access you will need to provide all the missing values manually and we can only run minimal validation on them.
